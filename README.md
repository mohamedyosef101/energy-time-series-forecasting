# Energy Consumption - Time Series Forecasting
Our goal in this project is to use the hourly power consumption data to predict the PJME in the future. This is done by developing a model that can be used to predict future values based on the past values of the time series.


### About the data
**[The hourly energy consumption data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption)** comes from PJM's website and are in megawatts (MW).
